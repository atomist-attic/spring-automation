# @atomist/spring-automation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atomist/spring-automation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atomist/spring-automation)

This repository contains Atomist automations for Spring Boot:
generators, editors and reviewers.

## Prerequisites

Below are brief instructions on how to get started running this
project yourself.  If you just want to use the functionality this
project provides, see the [Atomist documentation][docs].  For more
detailed information on developing automations, see
the [Atomist Developer Guide][dev].

[docs]: https://docs.atomist.com/ (Atomist User Guide)
[dev]: https://docs.atomist.com/developer/ (Atomist Developer Guide)

### Node.js

You will need to have [Node.js][node] installed.  To verify that the
right versions are installed, please run:

```
$ node -v
v8.4.0
$ npm -v
5.4.1
```

The `node` version should be 8 or greater and the `npm` version should
be 5 or greater.

[node]: https://nodejs.org/ (Node.js)

### Cloning the repository and installing dependencies

To get started run the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:atomist/spring-automation.git
$ cd spring-automation
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

### Configuring your environment

If this is the first time you will be running an Atomist API client
locally, you should first configure your system using the `atomist`
script:

```
$ `npm bin`/atomist config
```

The script does two things: records what Slack team you want your
automations running in and creates
a [GitHub personal access token][token] with "repo" and "read:org"
scopes.

The script will prompt you for you Slack team ID, or you can supply it
using the `--slack-team TEAM_ID` command-line option.  You must run
the automations in a Slack team of which you are a member.  You can
get the Slack team ID by typing `team` in a DM to the Atomist bot.

The script will prompt you for your GitHub credentials.  It needs them
to create the GitHub personal access token.  Atomist does not store
your credentials and only writes the generated token to your local
machine.

The Atomist API client authenticates using a GitHub personal access
token.  The Atomist API uses the token to confirm you are who you say
you are and are in a GitHub organization connected to the Slack team
in which you are running the automations.  In addition, it uses the
token when performing any operations that access the GitHub API.

## Starting up the automation-client

To start the client, run the following command:

```
$ npm run autostart
```

## Support

General support questions should be discussed in the `#support`
channel in our community Slack team
at [atomist-community.slack.com][slack].

If you find a problem, please create an [issue][].

## Development

You will need to install [node][] to build and test this project.

### Build and Test

Command | Reason
------- | ------
`npm install` | install all the required packages
`npm run build` | lint, compile, and test
`npm start` | start the Atomist automation client
`npm run autostart` | run the client, refreshing when files change
`npm run lint` | run tslint against the TypeScript
`npm run compile` | compile all TypeScript into JavaScript
`npm test` | run tests and ensure everything is working
`npm run autotest` | run tests continuously
`npm run clean` | remove stray compiled JavaScript files and build directory

### Release

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  The version in
the package.json must be the same as the tag.  For example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
$ git push --tags
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will publish
the NPM module and automatically create a GitHub release using the tag
name for the release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as
the contents of the release notes.
